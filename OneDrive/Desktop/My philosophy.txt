My philosophy:

Life being inherently characterized by suffering is the true nature of reality, as I see it. The suffering we experience is a consequence of our consciousness. Beings with higher levels of consciousness tend to suffer more than those with lower levels. For instance, ants are primarily governed by rules and lack the wide spectrum of emotions that humans possess. Consciousness of our existence leads to awareness of the choices we can make, i.e., free will, which further leads to the desire to pursue certain paths and achieve specific goals. As we are free to choose our actions, we must bear the consequences of our decisions we make.

Personally, I do not believe in an all-good and all-loving God, given the countless atrocities that humanity has witnessed. However, if we define God as the sum total of the values that guide an individual's actions, then everyone believes in some form of God. Some people worship money and fame, while others have other material desires as their focus. Various religious texts contain different values that individuals are expected to follow through stories. Values play a crucial role in an individual's functioning. Those who value personal gain and greed are likely to exhibit traits such as manipulation and narcissism, which may not be conducive to collaborative settings. On the other hand, those who value honesty and transparency are likely to thrive in collaborative settings as they inspire trust and reliance.

I do not necessarily believe that the events mentioned in religious texts are historical facts, but I appreciate the values that can be derived from the stories they contain. For example, from the parables in the Bible, I have learned the importance of kindness and the wise use of one's talents. However, the problem with religious texts is that people often interpret them literally without critically evaluating their contents. For instance, the Bible endorses slavery in passages such as 1 Peter 2:18 and sexual slavery in Exodus 21:7-8. It is imperative to exercise our own critical thinking and discernment to accept what is right and reject what is wrong in religious texts.

Science, on the other hand, involves the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation, experimentation, and testing of theories against empirical evidence. It provides us with a mechanism to understand the nature of reality.

Religion, in simple terms, encompasses an individual's set of beliefs and practices (values). Science and religion cannot be intermixed, as they deal with distinct areas. Scientific knowledge must be testable and falsifiable to fall within the domain of science, while values are abstract and cannot be subjected to empirical testing. It is possible for someone to be an atheist and yet be religious, as they can still hold strong values that they consider important.

I personally believe that life is characterized by suffering. To acknowledge this reality and yet continue to live life is the epitome of nobility. It is the ultimate decision we make, and we often refer to it as a "leap of faith." Despite the inherent suffering in life, we take the leap of faith in the belief that we can make positive changes in the world and help ourselves and others live better lives.
