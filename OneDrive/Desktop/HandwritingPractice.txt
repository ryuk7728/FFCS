The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs. How vexingly quick daft zebras jump. Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack. Waltz, nymph, for quick jigs vex. Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim. Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow. The five boxing wizards jump quickly. Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz. The jay, pig, fox, zebra, and my wolves quack. Jump quick, black dogs.
